## General Education Reflection

When I started at ISU my goals and aspirations were strictly technical. In general, I wanted to learn everything there is to know about computers, and that that would lead me to success. Throughout my years at ISU, though, my goals have changed. My career goals are now less technical and more about working environment and meaningfulness. Some of my general education classes helped me form these new goals. I want to do something that is both healthy and meaningful. I think these are much more attainable goals than wanting to learn everything.

My general education classes have really made me realize the impact my work has on the world. In my psychology classes I’ve learned that the mind is fragile and very easily biased. I have to keep these things in my mind when I am formulating engineering solutions. Not only do I take into perspective the technical aspects, but also things like how users will interact with the system, how the solution could affect a person’s feelings, and if I am making biased decisions. I’ve learned there’s almost always a human factor to the solutions of engineering problems, whether its safety, security, usefulness, ethics, or something else.

In addition to an impact on individuals, my work can have affect on a societal and global level. In my environmental studies course I learned about global processes that happen all around the Earth. This course helped me understand how fragile, but also how powerful, the planet is. A good engineer takes these things into account when solving engineering problems. In my decisions, I make sure I take environmental factors very seriously because one decision can make a huge difference when scaled globally.

General education courses gave me well-rounded insights into the world. Without these insights I could make poor decisions that negatively affect my career and the world around me.
