title: My Portfolio Site
---
I created this brand new portfolio for my portfolio class during my senior year. I was using Wordpress before
but it required too much maintenance and required me to host it myself. Instead, I have gone with the
[Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) static blog engine hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com).

I chose Jekyll because I can write blog posts and pages in Markdown or HTML, depending on what I need.
It has a templating language which allows me to write loops and basic logic for portfolio site. I used
the [Foundation](http://foundation.zurb.com) front-end framework because I had never used it before and it's very customizable. GitHub
Pages is free hosting provided by GitHub. It gets the content from a GitHub repository which is very
convenient.

In addition, I have placed my portfolio site behind [Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com) which allows
caching, optimization, and high availability.
