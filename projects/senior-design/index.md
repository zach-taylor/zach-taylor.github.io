Lighthouse is a Workiva-sponsored, open source software project. Lighthouse provides a solution for
managing deployments of Docker containers to an organization's cloud infrastructure. Lighthouse can be used
by developers and operations to easily see what Docker images are available and what hosts containers can be
deployed to.

My role on my senior design team is Key Concept Holder. This means I keep track of key ideas in the group
and understand the concepts that the project is working with. So far I have made contributions to several
aspects of the design, project plan, and mockup interfaces.

Lighthouse uses the Go language, AngularJS, Bootstrap, and Docker. The project's site is [here](https://lighthouse.github.io)
where weekly reports and other documents can be found.

Our team believes we can create a product that is easy-to-use, secure, and useful. Management of Docker infrastructure
is still fairly clunky right now so we hope to alleviate some of these problems for organizations using Docker.
