title: Unrolled Linked List

This project was created for my Com S 228 Data Structures class. It is an assignment requiring the creation of an
unrolled linked list written in Java. This data structure is essentially a modified linked
list where each contains an array of data rather than a single object.

The benefit of this type of data structure is performance. It increases cache performance as well as
decreases memory usage. More about this data structure can be found here:
